# car-race
a simple and intuitive car racing game
In the game, two players each control a rocket ship
with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the bottom of the screen to the top
Along the way are asteroids which the players must avoid the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles
This is a two-player arcade game
In the game, the two players each control a spaceship
which they fly from the bottom of the screen to the top
Along the way are dashes representing asteroids moving across the screen from left to right
which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down
if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again
The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score
which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time
represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game
with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out.
Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game
and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes
